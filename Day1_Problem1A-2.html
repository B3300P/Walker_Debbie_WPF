Day 1 PROBLEM SOLVING

Cat, Parrot and Seed

1) Define the problem

a) A man needs to transport a cat, parrot and a bag of seed across the river but can only take one at a time. He cannot leave the bird and cat alone or the bird and the seed alone.
b) What is not obvious is that the man will need to make more than one trip.
c) The goal is to get all three to the other side of the river without loosing anything.

2) Break the problem apart
a) The contraints are that the boat is only large enough to carry him and one object at a time.
