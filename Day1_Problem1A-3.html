Day 1 PROBLEM SOLVING

Cat, Parrot and Seed

1) Define the problem

a) A man needs to transport a cat, parrot and a bag of seed across the river but can only take one at a time. He cannot leave the bird and cat alone or the bird and the seed alone.
b) What is not obvious is that the man will need to make more than one trip.
c) The goal is to get all three to the other side of the river without loosing anything.

2) Break the problem apart

a) The contraints are that the boat is only large enough to carry him and one object at a time.
b) The sub-goals are to:
1. get the cat across
2. get the parrot across
3. get the seed across

4) Evaluate each potential solution

a) 1. Man to secure parrot to his head (since this does not take up boat space) and carry cat, then place cat on shore and go back for seed.
2. He could tie a rope to the cat and attatch it to the boat, put the parrot on his head and carry the seed. If he throws the cat into the water, the cat will pull the boat and get all three to the other side faster.
