//Conditional with an expression (this will be a Mathematical equation example)
//set kids height
//set min height
//add shoe lift disclaimer

var kidheight = 45;
// kid's height
var minheight = 48;
// min height to rid the coaster
var minheight = 2;
// has on sneakers that are 2 inches tall

if(kidheight >= minheight){
    //if the kid is taller than or equal to the min
    //height they can ride the coaster
    //will shoe lift affect the outcome?
    console.log("You can ride the coaster!!")
