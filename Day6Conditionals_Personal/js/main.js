//Problem: What mode of transportation should you choose for today?

//consider a mileage calculator into questions??
// mph = r=d/t; referenced (http://www.math.com/school/subject1/lessons/S1U2L3DP.html)
//var scooterTime = 10;
//var scooterRate = distance/scooterTime;
//var bikeTime = 10;
//var bikeRate = distance/bikeTime;
//var distance = 10
//_________________________

//Car, scooter or bike?
//Choose the best mode of transportation based on today's weather forecast? (enter weather link here)
//Bike (1pt), Scooter (1pt), Car (0pt)
