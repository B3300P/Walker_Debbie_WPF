var fruit = ["grape","pear", "apple", "bananas"];
//loop through to check for unit in array:

var totalFruit = 0;

if(fruit[0] === "grape"){
    totalFruit++;
}
    console.log(totalFruit);

//++ makes te totalFruit variable add 1 unit so that it will loop through by checking
//to see if it equals anything in the array.
