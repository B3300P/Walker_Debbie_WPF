 Write down the width, length and height of your square or rectangular cake if you are unable to find the number easily on a serving chart or by using the serving calculator. Use a handheld or computer-based calculator and enter the width. Multiply the width by the length of your cake. Multiply that total by the height of your cake. The number you get will be the cubic inches of your cake. Divide that number by 8, since each serving will total 8 cubic inches, and the final number will reflect the number of servings your cake will yield.
