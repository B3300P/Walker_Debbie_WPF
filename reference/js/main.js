//Problem: What is the average age of x people?

var Jeff= 28; // Jeff is a name of a variable holding an integer/number (which is a type of value) // There are three types of values; boolean, integer and string
var Jen=12; // SAME FOR ALL FOUR VARIABLES, they are INTEGERS/numbers so that I'm clear!!!!

// they are not strings, they are variables

// groupArray.length this code is used to dived a variable into itself - for example groupArray = 4 and .length divides groupArrays total by that number "4"

// Problem: After the move to Florida, I just found a lock-box from our last garage sale.
//I need to figure out what the total is.

//Given:
//There are 72 $1s.
//There are 12 $5s.
//There are 27 $10s.

// Declaration:
var oneDollars = 72;
var fiveDollars = 12;
var tenDollars = 27;
// Expression: x + y + z = w
var total = oneDollars + fiveDollars + tenDollars;
// Print expression to browser.
console.log ("The total in the lock box was $" + total + ".00.");


// Problem: The client wants a website in two days and only has a $3,000 budget.
//How much time will a small team have to work on it?

//Given:
//A Designer is $75 an hour.
//A Developer is $100 an hour.
//A Project manager is $75 an hour.
//A Writer is $75 an hour.

// Declaration
var designer = $75
var developer = $100
var projectManager = $75
var writer = $75
var budget = $3000
